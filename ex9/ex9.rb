# Here's some strange stuff, remember to type it exactly.
#Initializes days to a string containing 3 letter capped days of the week
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
#Initializes months to a string of the first 8 months seperated by newlines
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"
#puts the days
puts "Here are the days: #{days}"
#puts the months
puts "Here are the months: #{months}"
#puts a string where the newlines are printed
puts %q{
There's something going on here.
With this weird quote
We'll be able to type as as we like.
Even 4 LInes if we want, or 5, or 6.
}
